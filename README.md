# Popularity-Based-Book-Recommendation-System
*Overview
 This project implements a book recommendation system using a popularity-based approach. The system recommends books to users based on their overall popularity, determined by the number of users who have rated or read the books.

*Features
 Top-rated books: The system identifies books that have the highest number of ratings.
 Personalized recommendations: Given a popular book as an input, the system provides suggestions of similar popular books.
 Easy integration: The system can be integrated into other applications such as websites or libraries.
 
*Dataset
 The dataset consists of:

.Books: Information about various books including title, author, and ISBN.
.User Ratings: Data about the ratings provided by different users for the books.

*Technologies Used
.Python: The primary programming language used for implementing the recommendation system.
.Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
.NumPy: For numerical computations.
.Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing book popularity trends (optional).
.colab Notebook: For code execution and presentation.

*How It Works
 The system processes the dataset by:

.Aggregating the ratings for each book.
.Sorting the books based on their popularity (total number of ratings).
.Recommending the most popular books to users.

 For example: If you input the book "1984", the system will return popular books like:

Animal Farm by George Orwell
The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood
Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
